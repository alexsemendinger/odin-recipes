    <h2>About this recipe</h2>
    <p>My wife and I love to make these red lentils on a cold winter day.</p>
    <p>They require mostly pantry ingredients, so they're great when you're low on groceries.</p> 
    <p>And be sure to make enough for leftovers -- they're <em>excellent</em> the next day on toast!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>olive oil</li>

        <li>2 cups dry red lentils</li>

        <li>1 can unsweetened coconut milk</li>

        <li>1 can diced tomatoes</li>

        <li>1 yellow onion, cut however you like</li>

        <li>3 cloves garlic, diced</li>

        <li>some fresh ginger, diced</li>

        <li>paprika</li>

        <li>curry powder</li>

        <li>cayenne</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat some olive oil, throw in the onion, garlic, and ginger, cook until translucent / fragrant</li>

<li>Pour in the lentils. I like to toast them for a minute before putting in the water; I have no idea if this does anything.</li>

<li>Add the can of tomatoes and the coconut milk. Throw in another can-full of water, or a bit more if that doesn't look like enough. (But you can always add more water later, so be careful.)</li>

<li>Add salt, paprika, curry powder, and cayenne to taste.</li>

<li>Let simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the lentils are soft. If you want it to be thick and creamy, keep it on low heat for another 30 minutes. (But if you're impatient, you don't need to wait.)</li>
    </ol>
